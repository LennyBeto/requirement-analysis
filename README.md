# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository is a practical simulation of the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), applied to a Booking Management System. It meticulously documents the process of gathering, analyzing, and modeling software requirements using standard industry methods and tools. üõ†Ô∏è

## Project Goal and Deliverables
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how clear, structured, and validated requirements are fundamental for successful software development. The repository's detailed contents include:

- Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

- Use Cases

- User Stories

- Acceptance Criteria

- Supporting diagrams and models

## üìå What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical, early stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its primary job is to collect, evaluate, and formally document all the needs and expectations from stakeholders regarding the new software system. This includes defining both functional (what the system does) and non-functional (how it performs) requirements. Essentially, this phase serves as the bridge connecting the client's original vision with the technical implementation, ensuring everyone‚Äîfrom developers to clients‚Äîhas a clear, shared understanding of the system's objectives and constraints.

## üß† Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:

- Identify and define the scope of the system.
- Gather requirements from all relevant stakeholders.
- Document requirements clearly and unambiguously.
- Analyze and prioritize features based on business value and feasibility.
- Validate requirements to ensure completeness and correctness.
